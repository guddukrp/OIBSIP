        <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931 – 27 July
          2015 was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
          president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
          Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
          engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
          science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
          Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
          Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
          space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus
          came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
          development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
          technology. He also played a pivotal organisational,
          technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
          1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
          From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal
          scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the
          country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national
          hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a
          countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a
          less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing
          agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to
          health care and education.
